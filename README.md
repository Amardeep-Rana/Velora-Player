## 🔒 Permissions Breakdown

To provide the best media experience, Velora Player requires the following permissions. We use them **only** for the features mentioned:

1.  **Media Access (Video & Audio)**:
    *   *Usage*: The app needs to scan your device to find and list all your movies, videos, and music files. 
    *   *Granular Support*: On Android 13 and above, we use specific permissions for Video and Audio separately, following the latest security standards.
    *   *Privacy*: We only read media files; we never access your personal photos or documents.

2.  **External Storage (Legacy)**:
    *   *Usage*: Required for older Android versions to access your SD card and internal storage to play your downloaded content.

3.  **Wake Lock**:
    *   *Usage*: This prevents your phone screen from timing out and turning off while you are in the middle of a movie. It ensures an uninterrupted viewing experience.

4.  **Foreground Service**:
    *   *Usage*: Necessary to keep the playback engine alive and stable, ensuring your music doesn't stop when you minimize the app.
